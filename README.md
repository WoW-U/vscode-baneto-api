# Baneto Lua API

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides Lua library definitions for **Baneto**, enabling IntelliSense, autocompletion, and type checking for Baneto-specific APIs.

## Features

- **Baneto API Definitions**: Automatically adds Baneto Lua definitions to the `Lua.workspace.library` setting.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with the [Lua extension by sumneko](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) to provide IntelliSense and type checking for Baneto APIs.
- **Easy Setup**: Just install the extension, and it will configure everything for you.

## Usage

### Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use Baneto APIs with autocompletion and type checking:

```lua
---@type Baneto
local nn = ...

-- Use Baneto APIs with IntelliSense support
nn.Utils.JSON.encode({a = "1"}) -- Autocompletion and type checking will work here
```
